Welcome to the repository of the ShinyApp from single cell RNAseq data.
In this repository, you can find my ShinyApp: "BruggemanTim_ShinyApp.R". For this ShinyApp, two main data files where used: the CellsOfInterest_SLB.RDS and the stef_ALK_and_noALK_integrated_SLB.rds.
These files can be found in the RDSObjects directory.
Also a DEGenes.rds can be found in this directory. This file was used to make the DEGenes datatable and was made using the DEGenes.R script. 
To get a biological backround for the app, the published paper can be found in the link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223021739.

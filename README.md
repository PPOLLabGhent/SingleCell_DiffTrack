Welcome to the repository of the ShinyApp from single cell RNAseq data.
In this repository, you can find my ShinyApp: "BruggemanTim_ShinyApp.R". For this ShinyApp, two main data files where used: the CellsOfInterest_SLB.RDS and the stef_ALK_and_noALK_integrated_SLB.rds.
These files can be found in the RDSObjects directory (still have to be added).
The SingleCell_DiffTrack folder contains the ShinyApp together with the files needed in the ShinyApp: Pseudotime_Calculations.R (used to source calculations for the pseudotime), DEGenes.rds, PPOL_Handjes.png(logo).
The DEGenes.rds was used to make the DEGenes datatable and was made using the DEGenes.R script. This script can be found in the SupportScripts.
The files on how to publish the ShinyApp can be found in Publish_ShinyApp.
To get a biological backround for the app, the published paper can be found in the link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004223021739.
